# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a client that wants to expand their existing Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based, multi-platform version. The game involves teams guessing an image revealed over a timed round, and the new application must support multiple teams, unique game instances, and secure, scalable     gameplay in a distributed environment.
  
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  One strength of mine was clearly defining software requirements and constraints but in a simple, easy to understand fashion. It is important to keep in mind that these design documents are intended to be read and understood by business managers who may not have a technological background.
  
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Writing the design document made it easier to understand how various parts work together, which improved coding efficiency by dividing the system into distinct modules.
  
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I could go back and change one aspect of my work on these documents, I would improve the discussion of distributed systems and network dependencies. I discussed cloud deployment and scalability, but I could have done a better job of explaining how the game handles real-time interactions across several platforms, including load balancing, failover techniques, and latency management.
  
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  Understanding user needs was essential since, in order to build a seamless and interesting experience, we had to strike a balance between usability, performance, and maintainability. In order to take then user's needs into consideration, I found it helpful top imagine myself in their shoes and what I would expect out of such an application as a user.
  
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach for designing this software was incremental. Starting with the high level executive summary and using plain english, clearly defining user needs, and finally working out the detailed requirements and technical specifications. For similar projects, I would employ cloud-native development techniques, Agile approaches, RESTful APIs, and UML diagrams in future projects to increase design flexibility and clarity.
